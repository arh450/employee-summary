# Employee Summary

## Brief Description
This is a basic CLI application to create and obtain information for a development team using a combination of one manager, and any number of engineers/interns.  Using Node.js and NPM Inquirer a user is prompted a series of commands related to the development team's manager and the team's engineers/interns. Each employee (Manager/Engineer/Intern) require the following data:

* Name
* Employee ID
* Email

However there are unique properties for each employee role that is needed along with other employee properties that were stated above.  This required data is defined as the following:

* MANAGER
    * Office number
* ENGINEER
    * Github username
* INTERN
    * School information

Once a user is satisfied with they development team they have built they have the option to select "My team is complete", which will then generate a folder title "output".  Inside of this folder will contain an HMTL file titled "team.hmtl" and when opened displays the user's created development team and the information associated with each employee.
